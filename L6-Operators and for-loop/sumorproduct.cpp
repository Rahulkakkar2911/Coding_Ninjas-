/*
Write a program that asks the user for a number N and a choice C. And then give them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of all integers in the range 1 to N (both inclusive).
If C is equal to -
 1, then print the sum
 2, then print the product
 Any other number, then print '-1' (without the quotes)
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer N
Line 2 : Choice C
Output Format :
 Sum or product according to user's choice
